# Assignment 3: Looping to the DOM

### DOM manipulation in JS

I like the new use of JS but I realized it takes awhile to really understand what's going on and I still haven't fully grasped everything. I can understand what things do but I mostly struggle with where to put it or what to ID things

### The Practice

Like I said before I struggle a lot with where to ID things and get the results I want. It hasn't fully clicked for me and when I think I know, I get the dreaded error of death and retry for another fifteen minutes or so.

### Key Takeaways

I think I need to go back to the roots of this class and practice more with the lectures we're given. There's something about JS that doesn't click for me the same way HTMl clicked and I haven't put my finger on it quite yet.
