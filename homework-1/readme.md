# Assignment 1: Git Readme

### Websites vs Web Applications

I understand that websites and web applications can be different from each other. Web applications are apps created for browsers, such as Instagram on a browser. The web application functions like an app on a browser. Meanwhile a website doesn't have app features, such as a regular news article.

### VS Code & Extensions

Visual Studio Code is the application that allows you to create code then later use it for display. For this specific class we can display these codes on Github. Extensions help VS Code function on other applications or enhance the code within.

### Version Control, Git, & GitHub

The version control is the feature that helps publish items such as "readme.md" on Github. It's created through repositories and from there you can make a directory and fill in information to publish either publically or privately. On Github other users can view what was published such as this if it was published publically rather than privately.

### Markdown & Documentation

Markdown is the feature to use simple text that translates into html. Some examples of markdown would be **this** or something like _this_. I was able to create a bolded and italiced text through markdown simple text. Last example would be

- A simple list
- That can be unordered

1. Or they can be ordered
2. All created with simple text translated into html
